                My name is Valeria Villarroel, I am a very versatile artist who loves color and fun.
                I was born in Venezuela, but I call Utah home since 2017.

            <p>
                I’ve always had a big passion for painting and drawing, I found specially beautiful the fact
                that art it’s and universal language, it needs no words to be understood, just like smiles. That’s why I decided to study illustration in Salt Lake Community College, where I got my AAS in Ilustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the years I’ve participated in the “Black and White Literary Highland Literary Magazine”, in the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020
                editions. In 2018 and 2019 I won a honorific mention at the contest “Reflections” in the high school department. Additionally, I
                received acknowledgments for my piece “Euphoric Bliss”, an honorific mention by the second congressional district and the “USBE Purchase Award”, at the 48th Annual AllState High School Art Show, at the Springville Museum, where government private art
                organizations and colleges get together to support the arts. After the show, the USBE added the piece to their permanent private collection. I also participated in the Student
                Art Showcase in 2022.

                Most recently I work on private commissioned works and for-sale paintings from my home studio.
